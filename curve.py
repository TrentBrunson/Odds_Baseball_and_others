calculate descriptive statistics, I am requiring you to write your own code to do these
calculations (see Figure 1 for standard deviation formula).
• Display the descriptive statistics in a nicely formatted table (see Figure 2) – (NOTE: For
the formatted table, you should round the average and standard deviation values for
DISPLAY PURPOSES ONLY.)
• Use the grade curve table to determine the letter grade for each numeric score (NOTE:
Use the unrounded average and standard deviation values to calculate the cutoff
points. Round the cutoff points to 1 place after the decimal when determining letter
grades.)
• Create a new file named “Scores-and-Letter-Grades.txt” that contains the score and
letter grade on the same line (see sample first lines of new file in Figure 3)
• Count the total number of scores for each letter grade (i.e., number of As, Bs, Cs, etc.) –
HINT: A dictionary is an efficient tool for accumulating counts.
• Display a curved grade cut-off-point table (see Figure 2)
• Display a grade distribution table (see Figure 2)
