    "I graded the \"Conduct an Analysis\" part of Problem 4 on the Python Project I by ranking each team solution comparatively with the other teams. In my ranking, I considered the extent to which each team addressed the five prompts I provided in the project specifications: \n",
    "- i. Check to see if your data supports the 49% probability as described above\n",
    "- ii. Validation checks to ensure that the dice are “fair” (i.e., each number 1 to 6 has equal chance of occurring)\n",
    "- iii. Summary statistics such as the number of times double sixes occurred in 24 rolls, number of doubles rolled in 24 rolls\n",
    "- iv. Other interesting statistics\n",
    "- v. Use your creativity here!\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams that presented basic descriptive statistics with no interpretation were ranked lower than teams with more detailed interpretation of the results. Based on my comparison, I ended up with five bins with one or more team responses in each bin. I then assigned points to the bins from highest ranking (25 points) to lowest ranking (5 points) in 5 point increments (25, 20, 15, 10, 5). \n",
    "\n",
    "With permission, I am sharing the solution from the three teams that scored 20 points or higher in the cells below. I assigned each team response an anonymous team name and modified each solution to remove any identifying information (i.e,. author section of program header). The example solutions are presented in random order and labeled as Example A, Example B, and Example C."
