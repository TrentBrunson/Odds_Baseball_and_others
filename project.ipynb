Then filtering spaces and allowing for special characters and numbers did not return the string until invoking the .join() method.  Another challenge was error handling logic for exceptions in the test code, which actually became easier when passing parameters amongst functions; it provided clarity and defined boundaries allowing me to focus on subsets of errors.\n"
