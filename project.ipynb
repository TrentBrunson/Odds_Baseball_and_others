    "One challenge was stripping stray characters.  Stripping for letters worked, but it did not allow for punctuation in sentences.  Then filtering spaces and allowing for special characters and numbers did not return the string until invoking the .join() method.  Another challenge was error handling logic for exceptions in the test code, which actually became easier when passing parameters amongst functions; it provided clarity and defined boundaries allowing me to focus on subsets of errors.\n"

    "### We created a program to roll two dice 10,000 times in sets of 24 to see how many double sixes turn up.  Then we evaluated it against the probability calculations that says in 24 rolls of the dice, you should see a double six at least once 49% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the list to record the rolls was straightforward; there were differences when generating two output files via two different functions.  These returned different values (looking back, that is expected or else the random generator called is not random enough).  After working with a team mate, we collapsed those functions into one.  We used the file as inputs instead of passing parameters between functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finally, the program reports the results and visualizes the data in histograms and the distributions of the values was very, very even.  This model aligns very well with the probability calcuclations that double sixes will occur (35/36)^24, or about 49% of the time.\n"
