"""
Write a program to calculate the
percentage of games won by each team. Create a new data file named “mlb-division-standings2019.csv” that contains all the original data plus the percentage of games won. You should sort
the data in the new file first by division (ascending order) and second by percentage of games
won (descending order).
Display the division standings to the user. Each division should be listed separate from the other
divisions. Your standings should include rank (1-5), team, wins, losses, and win % for each team
under a division header. You should round the percentage of games won to two places after the
decimal."""
