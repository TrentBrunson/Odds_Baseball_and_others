    "The most difficult part of this problem was sorting by two columns. I learned that sorting a list of lists will use multiple columns in the order the columns are listed. Thus, I could arrange the columns to put \"division\" first and \"percentage of games won\" second. Then I could use the sort() method with no specified key. However this approach only works if all columns are sorted in the same order (e.g., ascending). \n",
    "\n",
    "A second identified solution was including two columns in a lambda function. I was able to sucessfully sort the list of lists by two \"columns\". However, this approach also assumes you want to sort all columns in the same order (e.g., all ascending or all descending). \n",
    "\n",
    "For numeric data types, you can multiple the value by -1 in the lambda function to \"trick\" the reverse=True for one column (see line 20). This trick can be shortened to just a negative sign in front of the column reference as shown in line 23. Unfortunatly, multiplying by negative does not work for non-numeric data types (eg., strings).\n",
    "\n",
    "I also found refernces to the \"itemgetter\" function (e.g., https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6666748/python-sort-list-of-lists-ascending-and-then-decending or https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36129954/python-order-list-of-lists-by-multiple-column-indexes). I have not implemented this approach in my code below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, I learned that lists in Python are \"stable\" and that I could sort the list multiple times starting with the \"inner most\" sort first. The first stackoverlow post above summarizes this technique and points to official Python documentation (see https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sort-stability-and-complex-sorts) for additional information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I first sorted by win percentage (see line 30) in reverse order. Then I sorted by division (see line 32). This solved my problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, I would likely choose to import Pandas and use a dataframe. The Pandas datafram has more robust sorting functionality (see https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sort_values.html). However, for this problem, I wanted to solve without using external libraries if possible. "
