    "One challenge was stripping stray characters.  Stripping for letters worked, but it did not allow for punctuation in sentences.  Then filtering spaces and allowing for special characters and numbers did not return the string until invoking the .join() method.  Another was error handling logic for exceptions in the test code, which actually became easier when passing parameters amongst functions."
